## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I was able to practice using setting height as a percentage instead of using vh in order to center the display.

### Continued development

There is a background showing on the bottom of the screenshot from my Samsung S21. I belive it is somehow related to my use of height on the body, but I would like to get an exact answer and fix it.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This is a great reference site which helped me remember some of the required syntax.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This is an excellent resource for finding answers to precise questions.
